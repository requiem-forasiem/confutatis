Confutatis: The Requiem web ui.


Confutatis Overview
=================

Originally written by Markus Alkio and Miika Keskinen, re-written and maintained by 
Nicolas Delon with the help of Yoann Vandoorselaere and Audrey Girard, on behalf of 
PreludeIDS Technologies, it was rapidly adopted as the new Requiem frontend. 

Confutatis is a professional looking application providing advanced feature like 
contextual filtering, aggregation, etc.
